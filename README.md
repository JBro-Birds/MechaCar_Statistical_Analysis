# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview of Project
AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to perform statistical analysis and design a statistical study to compare vechicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, (multiple linear regression, summary statistics and t-test), a summary interpretation of the findings will be provided.
